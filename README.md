Tool Utilized: Excel, GPT, Tableau

This project is a data cleaning and visualization using Spotify data provided by Onyx Data. 

I began by cleaning the data using Excel. There were several issues I had to fix before the data was ready to be inserted into Tableau. Firstly, there were encoding errors and special characters throughout the dataset. I started by finding and filtering all rows with special characters, and fixing the entries that I could. However, some of the entries I was not familiar with or had too many special characters to understand. For those entries I relied on GPT 3.5. I provided it all the songs, artists, and release dates containing special characters and instructed it to provide me with a clean list. Lastly, I checked for duplicate entries in the data using conditional formatting, and removed any duplicate rows. 

Once the data was cleaned, I created a dashboard in Tableau where users can see which tracks has the most streams on Spotify. This dashboard provides the user information about each track, and insights on how it performed among Spotify listeners.
